## About

The qEndpoint is a highly scalable triple store with full-text and GeoSPARQL support. It can be used as a standalone SPARQL endpoint, or as a dependency.

### Built With

- [Spring](https://spring.io/)
- [RDF-HDT](https://www.rdfhdt.org/)
- [RDF4J](https://rdf4j.org/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

For the backend/benchmark

- Java 11 or 17
- Maven

For the frontend (not mandatory to run the backend)

- see specific [README](./hdt-qs-frontend/README.md)

### Installation

#### Installers

Installers for Linux, MacOS and ~~Windows~~\* can be found [here](https://github.com/the-qa-company/qEndpoint/releases)

\* Windows version isn't available yet [#150](https://github.com/the-qa-company/qEndpoint/issues/150).

#### Code

##### Back-end
- Clone the qEndpoint from this link: `git clone https://github.com/the-qa-company/qEndpoint.git`
- Move to the back-end directory `cd hdt-qs-backend`
- Compile the project using this command: `mvn clean install -DskipTests`
- Run the project using `java -jar target/qendpoint-1.2.3-exec.jar` (replace the version by the latest version)

You can use the project as a dependency (replace the version by the latest version)

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.the_qa_company</groupId>
    <artifactId>qendpoint</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.3</version>
</dependency>
```

##### Front-end
- Clone the qEndpoint from this link: `git clone https://github.com/the-qa-company/qEndpoint.git`
- Move to the front-end directory `cd hdt-qs-frontend`
- Install the packages using `npm install`
- Run the project using `npm start`


## Usage

### Standalone

You can run the endpoint with this command

```bash
java -jar endpoint.jar &
```

you can find a template of [the application.properties file in the backend source](hdt-qs-backend/src/main/resources/application.properties)

If you have the HDT file of your graph, you can put it before loading the endpoint in the hdt-store directory (by default `hdt-store/index_dev.hdt`)

If you don't have the HDT, you can upload the dataset to the endpoint by running the command while the endpoint is running

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:1234/api/endpoint/load" -F "file=@mydataset.nt"
```

where `mydataset.nt` is the RDF file to load, you can use all [the formats used by RDF4J](https://rdf4j.org/javadoc/latest/org/eclipse/rdf4j/rio/RDFFormat.html).

### As a dependency

You can create a SPARQL repository using this method, don't forget to init the repository

```java
// Create a SPARQL repository
SparqlRepository repository = CompiledSail.compiler().compileToSparqlRepository();
// Init the repository
repository.init();
```

You can execute SPARQL queries using the `executeTupleQuery`, `executeBooleanQuery`, `executeGraphQuery` or `execute`.

```java
// execute the a tuple query
try (ClosableResult<TupleQueryResult> execute = sparqlRepository.executeTupleQuery(
        // the sparql query
        "SELECT * WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }",
        // the timeout
        10
)) {
    // get the result, no need to close it, closing execute will close the result
    TupleQueryResult result = execute.getResult();

    // the tuples
    for (BindingSet set : result) {
        System.out.println("Subject:   " + set.getValue("s"));
        System.out.println("Predicate: " + set.getValue("p"));
        System.out.println("Object:    " + set.getValue("o"));
    }
}
```

Don't forget to shutdown the repository after usage

```java
// Shutdown the repository (better to release resources)
repository.shutDown();
```

You can get the RDF4J repository with the `getRepository()` method.

```java
// get the rdf4j repository (if required)
SailRepository rdf4jRepo = repository.getRepository();
```

## Connecting with your Wikibase

- run the qEndpoint locally
- `cd wikibase`
- move the file `prefixes.sparql` to your qEndpoint installation
- (re-)start your endpoint to use the prefixes
- run 
  ```bash
  java -cp wikidata-query-tools-0.3.59-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar org.wikidata.query.rdf.tool.Update \
          --sparqlUrl http://localhost:1234/api/endpoint/sparql \
          --wikibaseHost https://linkedopendata.eu/ \
          --wikibaseUrl https://linkedopendata.eu/ \
          --conceptUri https://linkedopendata.eu/ \
          --wikibaseScheme https \
          --entityNamespaces 120,122 \
          --start 2022-06-28T11:27:08Z
  ```

  you can adapt the parameters to your wikibase, in this case we are querying the [Eu Knowledge Graph](https://linkedopendata.eu/), you may also change the start time.
